    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was a fresh <strong>Software Developer</strong>, I usually looked for libraries which were suit for programming language I used <strong>Ruby</strong>, in my case.</p>

<p>It is awesome that there is a <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> which is a framework for <strong>Ruby</strong>. Plus, there are lots of <a href="https://rubygems.org/">Ruby Gems</a> that are designed to help building software with <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Jump to the point, when I used any Ruby gems, I just built thing with its main and basic usage. Once I came up with an idea to build something more advanced along with that library, my brainstorm was to write the things from scratch. Then, I did research on google for some concepts.</p>

<p>Soon, there was another idea came to my brain. <em>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I read more document about the library I were using to see whether or not it had what I wanted?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Bang! It was just a few minutes searching the feature in its the document, I found the exactly thing as I wanted.</p>

<p>To sum up, it is good to know what main features exist in the library we use, but it is much better to discover everything it can do.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
