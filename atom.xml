    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has provided us cool and easy ways to modify EBS volume, or in other word is to modify disk space of our instance or server.</p>

<p>I am going to sum up of how we can achieve it by using AWS Console.</p>

<p>If we are running multiple instances and volumes, the first thing we need to know is which volume that is associated with which instance we want to modify.</p>

<p>If we open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> console and navigate to <strong>Volumes</strong> page, we will see a list of some volumes if we are running multiple instances. For somebody who has already named their volumes, that is okay for them, but as my first experience, I haven&rsquo;t named any of the volumes, so I don&rsquo;t know which Volume of my instance I am looking for to modify.</p>

<p>Worry not! To know which instance our volume is attached to, just click on the volume, and in the <strong>Description</strong> tab below, we can see the instance in <strong>Attachment information</strong>. After find out the instance it is attached to, I recommend to name your volume at this point, if you haven&rsquo;t, so it is helpful when we come back later and that we can catch it up immediately.</p>

<p>Okay so now we know which volume to be modified! BUT! Wait! It is recommended to create a <strong>Snapshot</strong> of your current volume before modifying.</p>

<p>I will just leave a link for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html">How to create a Snapshot</a>. It might take some time due to how big your volume is.</p>

<p>Once you already create a snapshot, then you&rsquo;re ready for modifying the volume.</p>

<p>Let select a volume, and choose the dropdown <strong>Actions</strong> button on the top, and select <strong>Modify Volume</strong>. We will see a modal window of Modify Volume, verify the Volume Type, adjust the size in GiB you like, and click <strong>Modify</strong> button, and <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>

<p>Last, modifying volume size has no effect until we tell the file system to get advantage of new storage size.
This is how you can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html">Extending a Linux File System after Resizing the Volume</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please&hellip;</strong> keep in mind that when we want to modify something like this, eg. Volume (disk space), Data, etc, we do have to do a back-up, like we were creating a <strong>Snapshot</strong> of the volume, so it safe in case we want to rollback or something. Plus, it is <strong>even more better</strong> if you can try it on a test instance and volume first before working on the live one.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/console-modify.html">Modifying an EBS Volume from the Console</a></p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <link href="http://pirunseng.github.io/blog/2017/12/19/continuous-integration-with-codeship/"/>
    <updated>2017-12-19T08:19:06+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://pirunseng.github.io/blog/2017/12/19/continuous-integration-with-codeship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Codeship</strong> is one of a very cool Continuous Integration (CI) platform. It comes with pre-installed various programming languages, frameworks and dependencies.</p>

<p>With a simple, yet powerful web UI and UX design, it makes us easy to get started in just a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Codeship</strong> allows developers to connect to different repositories such as <strong>Github</strong>, <strong>Gitlab</strong> and <strong>Bitbucket</strong>. On top of that, we can setup our testing environment and deployment targets. Whenever the code is pushed to the repository, then <strong>Codeship</strong> gets triggered and run our test. There is an API of the build status in which we can put it in somewhere like the README of our project. We can either enable or disable the build notification on our own.</p>

<p><strong>Codeship Basic is free!!</strong>
Register for a free account, then we are ready to ship our code so that we can sleep well at night.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_navbar.png" title="Navbar" ></p>

<p>Assume that we are already signed in. On the top navigation bar, click on <strong>Projects</strong>, you will as the screenshot above, layout might be changed due to current date.</p>

<p>By clicking on <strong>New Project</strong>, you will be asked to choose which repository you want to connect to.</p>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_repositories.png" title="Repositories" ></p>

<p>In my case, I click on Github and I&rsquo;ll come to this page in which I will have to put corresponding Git clone URL so that my repository and Codeship is connected.</p>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_connect_repo.png" title="Connect Repository" ></p>

<p>At the project types selection section, click on <strong>Select Basic project</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_select_plan.png" title="Select Project Type" ></p>

<p>Last but not least, we need to choose the setup command. These are the pre-installed languages, frameworks and dependencies as I have mentioned above. Choose the one you are working on. In my case, I will want to choose Ruby on Rails since I&rsquo;m building a web app with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_setup_command.png" title="Setup Command" ></p>

<p>Click <strong>Save and go to dashboard</strong>, you should see your first build status.</p>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_build_status.png" title="Build Status" ></p>

<p>The very last step (optional but recommended), we should display the build status on our repository using Codeship build status API. To do so, you might want to click on the build status, then click on <strong>Project Settings</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_project_settings.png" title="Project Settings" ></p>

<p>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, and at the <strong>Status Images</strong> section, we can use any of the image we would like to show the current status of our project. In my case, I use the <strong>Markdown Syntax</strong>. I put it in the README of my project, and here how it looks on my Github repository of the project I have connected to Codeship.</p>

<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/codeship/codeship_build_api.png" title="Codeship Build API" ></p>

<p>It has been a long day already, hasn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>

    <id>http://pirunseng.github.io/blog/2017/11/06/active-record-finder-methods-find-or-find-by</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There might be sometimes that we get an unexpected exception where we use ActiveRecord::FinderMethods <code>find</code> and <code>find_by</code>.</p>

<p>So we need to be sure whether to use <code>find</code> or <code>find_by</code> where we are finding active record.</p>

<p>The main difference between <code>find</code> and <code>find_by</code> is the answer to this question, <strong>what we want to return once the record is not found?</strong> We will want to use <code>find_by</code> when we want to return <strong><em>nil</em></strong> if no record is found while we use <code>find</code> to expect the exception, <strong><em>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound</em></strong>, to be raised.</p>

<p>To discover more about Active Record Finder Methods, please refer to the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FinderMethods.html">API document</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://pirunseng.github.io/blog/2017/10/23/how-to-upload-files-from-remote-location-with-carrierwave/"/>
    <updated>2017-10-23T22:24:02+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://pirunseng.github.io/blog/2017/10/23/how-to-upload-files-from-remote-location-with-carrierwave</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Carrierwave</strong> is a classier solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other Ruby web frameworks.</p>

<p>I am going to demonstrate <strong>How to: Upload files from a remote location to JSONB or Array image column</strong>.
For installation and configuration, I would recommend you to read <a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave">Carrierwave document</a>.</p>

<p>Let say we have an <strong>Avatar</strong> model with an <code>image</code> column of array data type.
To create a new Avatar record with an image:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>avatar = Avatar.new
</span><span class='line'>avatar.remote_image_urls = ['https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/25/25231.png']
</span><span class='line'>avatar.save</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> We use <code>remote_image_urls</code> for <strong>jsonb</strong> or <strong>array</strong> data type column while we use <code>remote_image_url</code> for <strong>string</strong> data type column.</p>

<p>Please feel tree to replace <code>image</code> to any column name you use to store the file or image. e.g If your <strong>Avatar</strong> model has a column named <code>photo</code>, then you might want to modify the syntax above to <code>remote_photo_url</code> and <code>remote_photo_urls</code>.</p>

<p>You can dig deeper to its source code <a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/87c37b706c560de6d01816f9ebaa15ce1c51ed58/lib/carrierwave/mount.rb">here</a>.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

Anyway, I sometimes feel not really good to spend much time looking for the things, but I still cannot find the right resources or solutions.</p>

<p>This makes me create a <em>simple app</em> called <strong>Fast Finder</strong> which <em>records all right resources and solutions</em> I have found. The main objective is to find the right thing faster. I hosted it on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, most resources are for <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> as I am a Rails Developer. Anyway, it will be for many more languages, programming languages, frameworks and technologies as it is growing and from your contribution.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was a fresh <strong>Software Developer</strong>, I usually looked for libraries which were suit for programming language I used <strong>Ruby</strong>, in my case.</p>

<p>It is awesome that there is a <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> which is a framework for <strong>Ruby</strong>. Plus, there are lots of <a href="https://rubygems.org/">Ruby Gems</a> that are designed to help building software with <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Jump to the point, when I used any Ruby gems, I just built thing with its main and basic usage. Once I came up with an idea to build something more advanced along with that library, my brainstorm was to write the things from scratch. Then, I did research on google for some concepts.</p>

<p>Soon, there was another idea came to my brain. <em>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I read more document about the library I were using to see whether or not it had what I wanted?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Bang! It was just a few minutes searching the feature in its the document, I found the exactly thing as I wanted.</p>

<p>To sum up, it is good to know what main features exist in the library we use, but it is much better to discover everything it can do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pirunseng.github.io/images/git.png" title="Git" alt="Git" /></p>

<p><strong>Git</strong> is awesome and that I&rsquo;ve used it along with my career, software development, so far.</p>

<p>I sometimes get confused doing git merge between branches. When it is a tough time preparing to release my feature to test server in which I have to merge the latest master branch, into my current working branch, let say <strong>update-layout</strong> branch.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, I have merged <strong>update-layout</strong> into <strong>master</strong>. Actually, I want to merge <strong>master</strong> into <strong>update-layout</strong>.</p>

<p>Luckily, I haven&rsquo;t pushed the master yet so that I can revert/undo merge safely.</p>

<p>To undo the merge, it is as simply as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay on <strong>master</strong> branch by <code>git checkout master</code></li>
<li>Type <code>git log</code> on the terminal to see the commit histories.</li>
<li>Find the latest commit of <strong>master</strong> branch we want to revert to.</li>
<li>Copy the commit <strong>sha</strong>, e.g. <strong>dbf0e49</strong>.</li>
<li>Back to terminal and type <code>git reset --hard dbf0e49</code></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s done! We&rsquo;re on the latest commit as we want to revert/undo merge.</li>
</ul>


<p>If we&rsquo;re ready to merge <strong>update-layout</strong> into <strong>master</strong> or redo merge, it can be done easily for just do the merge again.</p>

<p>Happy with Git!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First thing we need to do is to install <strong>Amazon Web Service Command Line Interface</strong> (AWS CLI).</p>

<p>Depending on your environment, there are different ways to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">install AWS CLI</a>. I&rsquo;m using Mac OSX, and I prefer to install it via Homebrew <code>brew install awscli</code>.</p>

<p>Then we need to configure awscli by running: <code>aws configure</code>. You will be prompted to put your AWS Access Key Id, Secret Key, Region and Output. The following is an example:</p>

<pre><code>Access key : foo
Secret key : bar
Region     : us-west-1
Output     : json
</code></pre>

<p>We are all set. Now, I gonna show you how we copy a specific file and an entire directory from Amazon S3.</p>

<p><strong>Copy a file : </strong> <code>aws s3 cp s3://bucket_name/dir/file.png local_path</code></p>

<p><strong>Copy a directory : </strong> <code>aws s3 cp --recursive s3://bucket_name/dir local_path</code></p>

<p>The example above, I show you how to copy a file, &lsquo;file.png&rsquo;, and an entire directory, &lsquo;dir&rsquo;, by specifying <code>--recursive</code> option from Amazon S3 to your local machine or directory where you specify <code>local_path</code>.</p>

    <id>http://pirunseng.github.io/blog/2017/10/20/backup-and-restore-postgres-database-from-amazon-rds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two things might happen when we do the backup and restore database. We need to know whether the database is located in local server or in any separate server like RDS.</p>

<p>Here, I&rsquo;d like to raise two ways of backup Postgres database. One is the local database, and other one is the separate database.</p>

<p><strong>Local Database</strong></p>

<pre><code>Backup: pg_dump -n schema_name -d db_name &gt; backup_filename.dump

Restore: psql db_name &lt; backup_filename.dump
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Host Database (Amazon RDS)</strong> (You will be prompted to type your database password.)</p>

<pre><code>Backup: pg_dump -h db_host -p db_port -U db_user -n schema_name -d db_name &gt; backup_filename.dump

Restore: psql db_name -h db_host -p db_port -U db_user &lt; backup_filename.dump
</code></pre>

<p>You should notice that we need to specify database host, port and user if we have the database setup in a host server, Amazon RDS in my case. That is the important point that some developers might forget.</p>

<p>For further detail of the other backup and restore options, please refer to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/">PostgreSQL docs</a> and look for database backup and that applies to the Postgres version you use.</p>

<p>Enjoy your DBA time!</p>

<p>If we haven&rsquo;t read the note of the document as the screenshot above, then we missed something. And what we missed is the prefix schema name on our table name. So, instead of <code>-n schema_name -t table_name</code>, we should use this <code>-t schema_name.table_name</code>.</p>
